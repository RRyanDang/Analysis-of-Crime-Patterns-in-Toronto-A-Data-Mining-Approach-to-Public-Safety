        "The crime dataset (`crime.csv`) is loaded into a pandas DataFrame. The notebook provides options to load the data either locally or directly from Google Drive.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing\n",
        "The data cleaning process involves several key steps:\n",
        "*   **Date Conversion**: `OCC_DATE` and `REPORT_DATE` columns are converted to datetime objects.\n",
        "*   **Handling \"NSA\" values**: \"NSA\" (Not Stated/Applicable) values are replaced with `np.nan` for consistent missing value representation.\n",
        "*   **Imputing Missing Dates**: Missing values in `OCC_YEAR`, `OCC_MONTH`, `OCC_DAY`, `OCC_DOY`, `OCC_DOW` are filled using information extracted from the `OCC_DATE` column.\n",
        "*   **Imputing Categorical Values**: Missing categorical values (e.g., `DIVISION`, `HOOD_158`) are filled with 'Unknown'.\n",
        "*   **Filtering Outliers**: Rows where `REPORT_DATE` and `OCC_DATE` differ by more than 20 years are removed.\n",
        "*   **Handling Small Numerical Values**: Exceptionally small numerical values (less than 1e-3) in numerical columns are replaced with `np.nan` and then imputed with the column's median to ensure data integrity.\n",
        "*   **Feature Engineering**:\n",
        "    *   **SEASON**: A 'SEASON' column is created by mapping `OCC_MONTH` to Winter, Spring, Summer, or Fall.\n",
        "    *   **Geo_Region**: The dataset is divided into five geographical regions (Central, North, South, East, West) based on latitude and longitude quantiles.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\n",
        "Several visualizations are generated to understand the crime data:\n",
        "1.  **Hourly Crime Trends Throughout the Week**: A heatmap showing the frequency of crimes by hour of the day and day of the week.\n",
        "2.  **Crime Category Distribution by Premises Type**: Bar plots illustrating the distribution of crime categories across different premises types, both in raw counts and normalized percentages.\n",
        "3.  **Crime Count by Premises Type and Geo Region**: A grouped bar chart showing crime counts segmented by premises type and the engineered geographical regions.\n",
        "4.  **Top 20 Crime Types**: A horizontal bar chart displaying the most frequent crime offenses.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Machine Learning Models\n",
        "The notebook implements four different machine learning models:\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. LSTM for Time Series Forecasting\n",
        "*   **Objective**: Predict future weekly crime counts based on historical data.\n",
        "*   **Preprocessing**: Crime data is grouped by `PREMISES_TYPE` and `OCC_DATE` (weekly frequency). Additional time-based features (`day_of_week`, `month`, `day_of_year`, `is_weekend`) are extracted. Categorical `PREMISES_TYPE` is one-hot encoded. Data is scaled using `MinMaxScaler`.\n",
        "*   **Model**: A Sequential LSTM model is built with two LSTM layers and Dense layers, compiled with `adam` optimizer and `mse` loss.\n",
        "*   **Evaluation**: The model's performance is evaluated using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) on the test set. A plot comparing actual vs. predicted values is generated.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. DBSCAN for Spatial Clustering\n",
        "*   **Objective**: Identify spatial clusters of crime incidents.\n",
        "*   **Preprocessing**: A 20% sample of the data is used to prevent memory issues. Only `LONG_WGS84`, `LAT_WGS84`, and `MCI_CATEGORY` are used. Latitude and longitude are scaled using `StandardScaler`.\n",
        "*   **Model**: DBSCAN algorithm is applied to the scaled coordinates. `eps` is set to 0.25 and `min_samples` to 60 to define clusters.\n",
        "*   **Visualization**: The spatial distribution of the top 4 crime types (Assault, Break and Enter, Auto Theft, Robbery) is visualized using a scatter plot, showing distinct crime patterns.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. Apriori for Association Rule Mining\n",
        "*   **Objective**: Discover associations between crime types, locations, and times.\n",
        "*   **Preprocessing**: Features include `MCI_CATEGORY` (Crime), `PREMISES_TYPE` (Location), `OCC_HOUR` (Time of Day), and `OCC_DOW` (Day of Week). These are one-hot encoded into a basket format.\n",
        "*   **Model**: The Apriori algorithm generates frequent itemsets, and then association rules are derived using a `min_support` of 0.01 and `min_threshold` (lift) of 1.1.\n",
        "*   **Analysis**: The strongest rules for target crimes (Assault, Robbery, Break and Enter, Auto Theft) are identified and interpreted.\n",
        "*   **Visualization**: A scatter plot shows the relationship between support, confidence, and lift for all generated rules. A heatmap (Risk Matrix) and a Network Graph (Crime Web) are used for advanced visualization of crime associations.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. CART for Crime Classification\n",
        "*   **Objective**: Classify the `MCI_CATEGORY` of a crime based on features like time, location, and premises type.\n",
        "*   **Preprocessing**: Features include `OCC_YEAR`, `OCC_MONTH`, `OCC_DOW`, `OCC_HOUR`, `PREMISES_TYPE`, and `DIVISION`. Categorical features and the target `MCI_CATEGORY` are label encoded. 'Theft Over' crimes are excluded from the analysis.\n",
        "*   **Model**: A Decision Tree Classifier (`DecisionTreeClassifier`) is trained with `max_depth=10` and `min_samples_leaf=50`.\n",
        "*   **Evaluation**: Model performance is assessed using accuracy, F1-score, and a classification report. A confusion matrix, feature importances, and a visualization of the decision tree structure (top 3 levels) are provided.\n",
        "*   **Cross-Validation**: K-Fold Cross-Validation (5-fold stratified) is implemented to prove the model's validity and accuracy across different data subsets, providing average metrics for robustness.\n",
